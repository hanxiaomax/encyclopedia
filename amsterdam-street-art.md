# History

Since 2010 ASA’s goal has been twofold. On the one hand, the organization strives to inform locals about Street Art in Amsterdam and around the world. On the other hand local artists, the creative industry in Amsterdam and international artists work together to exhibit a diverse range of works in a wide variety of places. The annual Amsterdam Street Art festival has provided a platform for local and international artists on the street of Amsterdam, but also in various associated galleries.
