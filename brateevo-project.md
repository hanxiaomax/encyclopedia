Abot project

The Brateevski containment pond that was created in the Brateevo districtin the south-east of Moscow in 1982. Across the lake there is an asymmetrical construction; a bridge with a concrete island where aboat station used to be situated.

Many changes have taken place over the years in this micro district: a shop was built on the south shore, a church on the north; the boat station is no longer there and the lake and its surroundings have fallen into decay. But the lake itself is still a focal point of the local landscape. People go for walks there, arrange dates and go fishing.

Moreover it is an amenity for the local authorities, a place of interest for commercial structures, a territory to invest in and to create a recreational zone. The artist ponders the future of the

Brateevski pond and invites the locals to join her. She initiates and runs a public opinion research project, organizes discussions of the lake's future fate and realistic plans for its upgrading. Implementing such a project will require a comprehensive collective effort—it will require the assistance of the local authorities, engineers, hydrologists, and architects. Working on this project will gauge the ability of the community to build a common future.2
