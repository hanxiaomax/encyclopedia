Airborne troops day (Rus. День ВДВ) created in 2013, St. Petersburg—is a video 2 min. 53 sec. of the performance by Anna Schiller in a so-called genre of the video of random events that occurred with Anna Schiller during a holiday of Airborne troops day in the summer of 2013 in St. Petersburg. Putting yourself in the space of militarist arbitrariness, Schiller embodies the exact opposite of what is unfolding before the eyes of the viewer: on the background of falling into the fountain drunken bodies in striped T-shirts, shorts and invitations to the toilet are the antitheses of aloofness, inaccessibility, ease heroine. Everything happens at the Palace Square and its surroundings, which are a symbol of the cultural capital, which can also be interpreted ambiguously: either space in the metaphor of the modern political process, with its militaristic sentiments and care of cultural values, whether the approach contrary to the last even through placing a certain ideal image in cultureless nightmarish reality. Schiller leaves the end open, dancing, going into the night, it becomes a follower, which is now ready to follow her.
