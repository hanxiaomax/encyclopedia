# "Sergeenko" Scandal of 2018

On January 23, designer Ulyana Sergeyenko presented her summer collection of clothes in Paris, at the Fashion Week. Media paid more attention not to the collection itself, but to the invitation that Sergeyenko sent to her friend and founder of the international edition about the fashion and style of the Buro 24/7 Miroslav Dumas. On the envelope it was written: "To my niggaz in Paris" ("To my niggas in Paris"). The day before the show, Miroslava Duma posted an invitation to the presentation of the collection, which she herself sent to Ulyana Sergeyenko. Bloggers and fashion magazines were vigorously discussing the racist expression that caused a series of accusatory public statements and the release of Miroslova from the board of directors of the store The Tot <span id="a3">[\[3\]](#f3)</span>.
